# GettingCleaningDataProject
Course project for the Coursera Course Getting and Cleaning Data

We were supplied with three separate training and test files; one that contained the subject information, one contained the activity information, and one contained data obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope in their cellphones.

We were tasked with creating two scripts; one that combines all six files and creates a clean dataset that then only included data columns that had the mean or standard deviation of the particular measurements.The second takes that tidy dataset and calulates the mean of each variable, grouped by Subject and Activity.

This repo included this README.md file, a codebook, and the R script to create the tidy dataset and a second dataset that gives the average for each data column grouped by the Subject and Activity.
